Algorithms-Assignment04
=======================

Final Project for my Algorithms class. Implementation of the Knapsack Problem.

The program will take in a file containing the potential items and ask for the maximum weight under those conditions.

The file will have one item per line and will be in the format: value.weight
ex. An item of value 10 and weight 5 will display as 10.5

To compile run "g++ main.cpp Knapsack.cpp -o Knapsack"

To run the program run "./Knapsack fileName"

To run and see the generated table run "./Knapsack fileName -t"
